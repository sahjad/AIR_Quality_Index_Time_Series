# AIR_Quality_Index_Time_Series
Problem Statement:</B></strong> Air pollution not only causes these health-related problems like cardiovascular and respiratory illness but has a deep connection in the economy of the country. 
Our product aims at revolutionising the lifestyle of the people into a much healthier one, however, the main issue crops in as it is impossible to trace cleaner air and its after effects from a vast infinite volume of space. 
Our devices would work consistently and efficiently but can’t be bifurcated from the overall data of air quality index which is being captured by the monitoring stations of Central Pollution Control Boards (CPCB). 
Therefore, we have come up with an approach of bringing down the Average Concentration Values of PM10, PM 2.5, NOx, SO2 and CO particles. 
Extrawatt’s Renewables pvt. Ltd. Is producing a product called Wind Panel which aims at reducing the average concentration levels of PM10, PM 2.5 and CO particles to prevent air pollution and provide healthy lifestyle to the people of Delhi. So, our main objective is:
•	To find out how many devices would be required within the Delhi/NCR region to bring down the average PM concentration level by 10-25 % in the next 5 years.
